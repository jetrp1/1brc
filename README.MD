# 1BRC

The [1 Billion Row Challenge](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc) is a challenge for Java developers to push the limits of Java and their own skills. I have been interested in this project, but i want to give it a try in python. I know many people have already done this, but this is for my own enjoyment and for my own learning experience.

### Tools
I have made my own tools for this project instead of using the tools that are already provided in the 1BRC challenge, Mostly because I don't want to setup a java environment when I have no intention of using that installation again. Additionally below are some of the tools that i used, and might be helpful for other people to use if they wish to copy this challenge.

#### Testing Data
The original challenge used a city list from [SimpleMaps.com](https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities) I have used the same source, but I did not clean up the data like seen [here](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc/blob/main/data/weather_stations.csv). The create_measurements.py script uses this data also. One of the challenges that I have come across is to also make this process faster. Its something else to learn from and has a different set of challenges. And Yes, I know someone has already done this too. The process for this is recorded in the `OPTIMIZING_CREATE_MEASUREMENTS.MD` file.
